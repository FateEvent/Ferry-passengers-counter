Welcome to Ferry Passengers Count, a simple app developed for improving my skills on JavaScript and whose function is counting passengers enter the passenger ferry of your imagination.

It is based on a project developed by Per Harald Borgen for a tutorial on Scrimba.com.

The result is visible on [Netlify](https://bejewelled-nasturtium-1d2205.netlify.app).
